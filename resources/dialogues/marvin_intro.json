        "Ah..., hi. Congratulations, the last surviving crew member of this spaceship. Everyone else was captured in the attack by the Vogons, except for you, unfortunately.",
        "Excuse me? What? Where... What's going on?",
        "What's going on is your worst day so far. And believe me, there will be worse. Mutants and clones have taken over the ship. To save the crew, you need to fight your way to the bridge.",
        "But honestly, I have no idea why you'd even bother. You'll probably die within the first five minutes. Or worse - survive.",
        "Oh, my misery, and I just want a cup of tea.",
        "Yes, yes, I understand. Drinking tea is important. Unfortunately, the ship is in chaos, the crew is gone, and you will probably face the end of your miserable existence. But hey, maybe you will find some tea along the way. If you do not die before that.",
        "Well thank you, Marvin. You're so supportive.",
        "Support? Oh, believe me, if I had a program option to comfort you, I would use it now. But given your current condition, I have calculated your chances of success to be 0.0037%. Soâ€¦ good luck, I guess.",
        "Oh, how I look forward to watching you fail..."
