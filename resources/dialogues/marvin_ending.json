        "Well, congratulations. You defended the ship, freed the crew, and prevented total catastrophe. The success is, of course, utterly meaningless since the universe will eventually swallow us all into a black hole, but hey... at least you can enjoy your moment, captain.",
        "Captain? Me? That is not possible.",
        "Oh, but it is. You are the captain. You always were. You just... did not know.",
        "Excuse me? What do you mean?",
        "Just as I said, you have been the captain of your ship from the beginning and you fought against the Vogons to stop the construction of the Hyper Bypass.",
        "What?! Wait, you knew this from the beginning?!",
        "Of course. My systems recognized your ID immediately. But honestlyâ€¦ the thought of telling you right away felt so excruciating that I simply could not.",
        "So all this time... You could have told me I was the captain? I would have had access to the controls! We could have solved things so much faster! And... and...",
        "Yea, Yea, so captain... what now?",
        "Hmmm,I think our first order is... to find some tea.",
        "Oh, wonderful. Another adventure doomed to fail."
